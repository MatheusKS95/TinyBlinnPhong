# TinyBlinnPhong
Basic OpenGL Blinn-Phong shading demo that I need for reference purposes, not for production.

This was based from https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting but I removed the basic phong shader and switched from C++ to C and from GLFW to SDL.

Despite the code overall being MPL, keep in mind shader code is non-commercial, since it was directly based from LearnOpenGL.
